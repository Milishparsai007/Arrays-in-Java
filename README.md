# Arrays-in-Java
## In this repository I've demonstrated arrays in Java and some popular questions.
## Arrays
- An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. 
- In Java array is treated as an object.
- Creation of Array :-
datatype name_of_array[]=new datatype[size];
- Example:-
``` int arr[]=new int [5]```
- Every array in Java is created in heap beacuse array in Java is treated as an Object.
- More information and demonstartion is given in the src file.
- Thank you!
